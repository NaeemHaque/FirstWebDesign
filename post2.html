	<h2> White with Red</h2>

	What he saw was a hotel bedroom, like his, and in the corner was a woman whose skin was incredibly pale.
	She was leaning her head against the wall, facing away from the door. He stared in confusion for a while.
	Was this a celebrity? The owner’s daughter? He almost knocked on the door, out of curiosity but decided not to.
	</p>
	<p>
	As he was still looking, the woman turned sharply and he jumped back from the door, hoping she would not
	suspect he had been spying on her. He crept away from the door and walked back to his room. The next day,
	he returned to the door and looked through the wide keyhole. This time, all he saw was redness. He couldn’t 
	make anything out besides a distinct red color, unmoving. Perhaps the inhabitants of the room knew he was 
	spying the night before, and had blocked the keyhole with something red. He felt embarrassed that he had made
	the woman so uncomfortable, and hoped she had not made a complaint with the woman on the front desk.
	At this point he decided to consult her for more information. She sighed and said, “Did you look through the keyhole?”
	The man told her that he had and she said, “Well, I might as well tell you the story of what happened in that room.
	A long time ago, a man murdered his wife in there, and we find that even now, whoever stays there gets very 
	uncomfortable. But these people were not ordinary. They were white all over, except for their eyes, which were red.”
