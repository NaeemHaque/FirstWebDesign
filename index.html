			In June 1972, a woman appeared in Cedar Senai hospital in nothing but a white, blood-covered gown.
            Now this, in itself, should not be too surprising as people often have accidents nearby and come to
			the nearest hospital for medical attention, but there were two things that caused people who saw her
			to vomit and flee in terror.
            The first being that she wasnâ€™t exactly human. She resembled something close to a mannequin, but had
			the dexterity and fluidity of a normal human being. Her face was as flawless as a mannequins, devoid
			of eyebrows and smeared in make-up.
            There was a kitten clamped in her jaws so unnaturally tight that no teeth could be seen, and the
			blood was still squirting out over her gown and onto the floor. She then pulled it out of her mouth,
			tossed it aside and collapsed.....

			A man went to a hotel and walked up to the front desk to check in. The woman at the desk gave him
			his key and told him that on the way to his room, there was a door with no number that was locked
			and no one was allowed in there. She explained that it was a storeroom, and that it was out of bounds.
			She reminded him of this several times before allowing him upstairs. So he followed the instructions 
			of the woman at the front desk, going straight to his room, and going to bed.
			However, the insistence of the woman had piqued his curiosity, so the next night he walked down the 
			hall to the door and tried the handle. Sure enough it was locked. He bent down and looked through the
			wide keyhole. Cold air passed through it, chilling his eye......
